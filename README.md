# ienchancer-xg
1.INTRODUCTION  

The program is developed for enchaner prediction, including five individual feature-based models: spectrum profile, mismatch profile, subsequence profile, PSSM and PseDNC, and ensemble learning model. Before the prediction, please make sure your computer has installed the software: the python package: repDNA and shap.  
repDNA (http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/repDNA/).  
pip install shap //python  

2.DATASETS  

Here, there are four datasets:enchancer, non-enchancer, strong enchancer, weak enchancer.  

3.ATTENTION  

If you use the PseDNC models, you should use python environmentï¼špython 2.7.  
If you use the shap models,you shoule use python environment:python 3.6.
